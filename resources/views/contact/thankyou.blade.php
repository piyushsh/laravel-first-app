            <h2>Contact Piyush</h2>
            <p>I am currently employed fulltime and therefor can't help you with programming problems. I highly recommend visitng StackOverflow for all your programming related questions, even for questions about funnelweb or websync.</p>
            <p>I do take on a few small subcontracting jobs, but can afford to be quite selective considering I'm already employed fulltime. I will only take on jobs that are particularly relevant to my hobbies (ie: fun for me) and/or when I can trade some computer work for bicycle parts, camping stuff or other toys.</p>

            <h3 class="alert-success">Thank you, for contacting me. I'll get back to you ASAP.</h3>
